Alt text uses:
Adding alternative text to images on your site is a principle of web accessibility.

Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the page.

Alt text will be displayed in place of an image if an image file cannot load.

Alt text provides better image context/descriptions to search engine crawlers, helping them to index and rank an image properly in image search. It also provides search engines with contextual information about the content on the page.
